# AxoLang
A fun project I started to learn Vim and C. This is the first and only thing I have made with either, but it has been very fun and much easier than I had imagined. It is not yet complete but is more of something fun to work on in my free time. It is a very fun way to learn what C can do and how it works.

## Goals
- [X] Allow the compiler to lex the tokens of a file
- [ ] Add identifier support and enough tokens to make the language practical
- [ ] Transpile the tokens to valid C code files
- [ ] Handle syntax errors and illegal token placements before the C compiler
- [ ] Add features that make writing it more contvient than writing C
- [ ] Support pointers and add basic memory safety features

## Why AxoLang
At the moment there is no practical use for this language, but I have greatly enjoyed seeing that it actually works as I imagined it.
